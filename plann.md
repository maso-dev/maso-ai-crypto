## 1. Platform Choice: Start with One
Your idea to support Nexo, Coinbase, and Binance is great for a full-fledged product. For a 5-week POC, however, integrating with multiple platforms will consume most of your time.

Big Idea: Multi-platform support.

Small Action: Pick one platform with a strong, well-documented API. I recommend Coinbase. Their Advanced Trade API is robust, designed for this kind of programmatic trading, and has tons of community support and examples. We can build the agent's core logic independently of the platform, so adding Nexo or Binance later will be much easier.

## 2. Agent "Brain": Rules First, AI Later
An agent that uses "AI sentiment gods" is the ultimate goal, but defining and implementing that is a huge project in itself. It can be a black box that's hard to debug.

Big Idea: An AI-driven agent using market sentiment.

Small Action: Start with a simple, rule-based agent. We can use clear, testable technical indicators. This gives us predictable behavior.

A great starting point is using the Relative Strength Index (RSI):

Rule 1 (Buy): If a token's RSI drops below 30 (often seen as "oversold"), the agent suggests buying.

Rule 2 (Sell): If a token's RSI goes above 70 (often seen as "overbought"), the agent suggests selling.

This is a concrete strategy we can code and test reliably. We can add more indicators like Moving Averages later to make it smarter.

## 3. Core Action: Simple Rebalancing
Portfolio growth is the main goal. Let's simplify how we achieve that initially. Things like inflation are too complex for a POC.

Big Idea: Complex portfolio management using dual investments, staking, etc.

Small Action: Focus on basic spot trading to rebalance a portfolio. We'll define a target allocation in a configuration file.

For example, your strategy could be:

Bitcoin (BTC): 40%

Ethereum (ETH): 40%

USD Coin (USDC): 20%

The agent's job will be to execute buys or sells to maintain this balance. If a BTC rally pushes its value to 50% of your portfolio, the agent will calculate a sell order to bring it back to 40% and reinvest the profits into ETH or USDC.

## 4. Configuration: A Simple File, Not a UI
Building a user interface is very time-consuming. We can get the same functionality much faster.

Big Idea: A full strategy configuration UI.

Small Action: Use a simple config.json file. This local file will hold all the user's settings. It's easy to create, read, and modify. We can put everything here:

API Keys (for Coinbase).

Target portfolio allocation ("BTC": 0.4, "ETH": 0.4, "USDC": 0.2).

Risk parameters (e.g., "max_trade_size_percent": 0.1 to limit any single trade to 10% of the portfolio).

The agent's strategy rules (e.g., RSI thresholds).

## 5. Agent Execution: Crawl, Walk, Run üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Going straight to a fully autonomous agent that trades with real money is risky. Let's build up to it safely.

Big Idea: An agent that executes trades, sometimes asking for validation.

Small Action: Develop the agent in three phases.

Phase 1: The "Observer" üïµÔ∏è

The agent connects to your wallet, reads your balances, and monitors market data.

Based on your strategy, it logs the actions it would take to a text file (e.g., [2025-07-16 15:30:00] SUGGEST: SELL 0.05 BTC).

No actual trading occurs. This is the safest way to test your logic.

Phase 2: The "Assistant" üë®‚Äçüíº

The agent does everything the Observer does, but instead of just logging, it prompts you for approval.

Example: Found rebalancing opportunity: SELL 0.05 BTC. Execute? (y/n)

This lets you stay in control while validating the agent's decisions with real-world outcomes.

Phase 3: The "Autonomous Agent" ü§ñ (The Stretch Goal)

Once you trust the agent's logic after running it in the first two phases, you can add a flag in your config.json like "autonomous_mode": true.

When this is on, the agent executes trades automatically without asking.
