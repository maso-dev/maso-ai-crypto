Hi
I am sharing feedback for your proposal as the form is still broken

This is an exceptionally comprehensive and well-structured proposal that clearly addresses a real market problem with strong technical sophistication. The hybrid Graph RAG architecture combining Milvus and Neo4j is innovative, and the integration with live portfolio data via Binance API creates genuine personalization that sets it apart from generic crypto tools
Suggestions for improvement
Missing data exploration and cleaning documentation - While you mention data quality checks, Steps 6-8 from the capstone need more detail. Discuss how you'll explore the NewsAPI data structure, handle inconsistent article formats, missing metadata, or duplicate content across sources. Document specific cleaning steps like handling special characters in crypto ticker symbols, standardizing date formats, or dealing with paywalled article snippets.
Tech stack justifications could be stronger - While you list technologies, provide more comparative reasoning. Why Milvus over Pinecone or Weaviate specifically? Why Neo4j over AWS Neptune? Consider mentioning cost implications, performance benchmarks, or specific features that make these choices superior for your use case rather than just general capabilities.
Data quality challenges need deeper analysis - Crypto news is notorious for misinformation, pump-and-dump schemes, and coordinated manipulation. Discuss how you'll detect and filter low-quality sources, handle conflicting information across outlets, validate price data accuracy, and prevent the agent from acting on potentially manipulated information that could harm users financially.
System design diagram needs technical architecture view - Your data flow diagram is good, but add a technical system architecture showing how components interact at the infrastructure level. Include details about authentication flows, API rate limiting implementation, database connection pooling, caching layers, and error handling between services.
Note - The feedback above is only a suggestion for you to consider in order to submit a high quality project. While some specification steps may be missing or lack detailed explanation at the moment, this is common for initial submissions and can be addressed in your final submission
